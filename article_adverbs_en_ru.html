<h2>Adverbs</h2>
<h3>Forming adverbs </h3>
In most cases, to create an adverb we simply add –ly to the adjective:

Quick becomes quickly, slow becomes slowly, etc.

Some adverbs are irregular, however. Here’s a list of common irregular adverbs in English:

Irregular adverbs
Most adverbs are formed by adding -ly to an adjective (e.g. slow ⇒ slowly). Here is a list of irregular adverbs, i.e. adverbs which do not follow the normal rule.
Adjective	Adverb
good	    well
fast	    fast
hard	    hard
late	    late
early	    early
daily	    daily
straight	straight
wrong	    wrong, wrongly

<h3>Forming comparative and superlative adverbs</h3>
With adverbs formed from adjectives by adding -ly to the end you can form the comparative and superlative forms with <p>more</p> and </p>most</p>.

Adjective	Adverb	Comparative Adverb	Superlative Adverb
quiet	    quietly	    more quietly	  most quietly
careful	  carefully	  more carefully	most carefully
happy	    happily	    more happily	  most happily

For adverbs which retain the same form as the adjective form, we add <p>-er</p> to form the comparative and <p>-est</p> to form the superlative.

Adjective	Adverb	Comparative Adverb	Superlative Adverb
hard	    hard	  harder	            hardest
fast	    fast	  faster	            fastest
early	    early	  earlier	            earliest
